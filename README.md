# Impulse

Impulse is a small real-time age ticker app I wrote for iOS/watchOS. It was inspired by [Alex MacCaw](https://twitter.com/maccaw)'s [Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/motivation/ofdgfpchbidcgncgfpdlpclnpaemakoj) :+1:

I tried to submit this to the store, but the binary got rejected since "the usefulness of [the] app is limited by the minimal features it includes." :neutral_face: So, I decided to open source it instead :rocket:
